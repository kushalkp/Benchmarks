The out-of-order machine has 4 main stages: Issue, Dispatch, Broadcast and Commit.
In all the codes, any variable name starting with T_ represents the initial symbolic state.
Upon successfully issuing an instruction, state T_ changes to state U1_.
Dispatching an instruction changes state U1_ to state U2_.
Broadcasting a result changes state U2_ to state U3_.
Committing an instruction gives the final state U4_.

In the Non_Buggy folder, the benchmarks are bug-free and Trojan-free. The invariants can be found in the following lines.
Invariant 1: Line 4952 (T_state) and Line 6480 (U4_State).
Invariant 2: Lines 5099 to 5194 (T_state) and Lines 6720 to 6815 (U4_State).
