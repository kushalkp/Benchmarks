The out-of-order machine has 4 main stages: Issue, Dispatch, Broadcast and Commit.
In all the codes, any variable name starting with T_ represents the initial symbolic state.
Upon successfully issuing an instruction, state T_ changes to state U1_.
Updating the microarchitecture changes state U1_ to state U2_.
Dispatching an instruction, Broadcasting a result and updating the microarchitecture changes state U2_ to state U3_.
Committing an instruction gives the final state U4_.

In the Non_Buggy folder, the benchmarks are bug-free and Trojan-free. The invariants can be found in the following lines.
Invariant 1: Refer to Invariant1.smt2 file in Lines 4952 to 5235 (T_state) and Lines 6762 to 6833 (U4_State).
Invariant 2: Refer to Invariant2.smt2 file in Lines 5167 to 5262 (T_state) and Lines 6787 to 6884 (U4_State).
Invariant 3a: Refer to Invariant3.smt2 file in Lines 6332 to 44858 (T_state) and Lines 117718 to 156244 (U4_State).

T/U4_Main_LTag in SMT benchmarks is the same as mrf mentioned in the invariant formulae in the paper.
T/U4_RS_ROB_Dst in SMT benchmarks is the same as RS.DstTag in the invariant formulae in the paper.

Experiments which demonstrate the triggering of LTag and MRF Trojans can be found in the Experiments folder. For the LTag trojan, we first show the property not
getting violated for the Trojan free model but produces a counter example for the model with the embedded PC trojan. Similar experiment is performed on the MRF
trojan.

In the LTag_Trojans folder, the PC trojan, the Rob Opcode trojan, the Timer trojan and the RF6 trojan, can be found on line 2176 in all invariant files.
The LTag bug can be found on lines 2661 and 2673 in all the invariant files in the LTag_Trojans -> Bug folder.

In the MRF_Trojans folder, all the Trojans and the bugs can be found on line 2064 in all the invariant files.
